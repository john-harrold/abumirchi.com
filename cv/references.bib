	abstract = {Two-pore physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has demonstrated its potential in describing the pharmacokinetics (PK) of different-size proteins. However, all existing two-pore models lack either diverse proteins for validation or interspecies extrapolation. To fill the gap, here we have developed and optimized a translational two-pore PBPK model that can characterize plasma and tissue disposition of different-size proteins in mice, rats, monkeys, and humans. Datasets used for model development include more than 15 types of proteins: IgG (150 kDa), F(ab)2 (100 kDa), minibody (80 kDa), Fc-containing proteins (205, 200, 110, 105, 92, 84, 81, 65, or 60 kDa), albumin conjugate (85.7 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), Fab (50 kDa), diabody (50 kDa), scFv (27 kDa), dAb2 (23.5 kDa), proteins with an albumin-binding domain (26, 23.5, 22, 16, 14, or 13 kDa), nanobody (13 kDa), and other proteins (110, 65, or 60 kDa). The PBPK model incorporates: (i) molecular weight (MW)-dependent extravasation through large and small pores via diffusion and filtration, (ii) MW-dependent renal filtration, (iii) endosomal FcRn-mediated protection from catabolism for IgG and albumin-related modalities, and (iv) competition for FcRn binding from endogenous IgG and albumin. The finalized model can well characterize PK of most of these proteins, with area under the curve predicted within two-fold error. The model also provides insights into contribution of renal filtration and lysosomal degradation towards total elimination of proteins, and contribution of paracellular convection/diffusion and transcytosis towards extravasation. The PBPK model presented here represents a cross-modality, cross-species platform that can be used for development of novel biologics.},

	abstract = {SEA-TGT is a human nonfucosylated monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin (Ig) and ITIM domains (TIGIT) protein. TIGIT is an immunoregulatory receptor expressed on activated and memory T cells, Tregs, and NK cells. TIGIT binding to CD155 and CD112 on tumor cells drives an inhibitory signal resulting in decreased T cell functionality. TIGIT targeting has been reported to release these inhibitory signals, drive Treg depletion, augment CD8+ T cell generation, and promote anti-tumor responses. SGNTGT-001 (NCT04254107) is a phase 1 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and tolerability of SEA-TGT as monotherapy in solid tumors and lymphomas at doses ranging from 0.01 to 6 mg/kg. Because an MTD was not identified in dose escalation, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints were measured to assess biological activity and inform dose selection. The biological activity of SEA-TGT as monotherapy was compared across different dose levels using a clinical utility index (CUI), which mathematically integrated multiple clinically-meaningful PK and PD endpoints into a single readout. PD endpoints included NK and CD8+ T cell proliferation, maintenance of overall peripheral CD8+ T cell numbers, depletion of peripheral regulatory T cells, and peripheral target engagement. The PK endpoint was pharmacokinetic linearity. Surrogates of predicted tumor efficacy metrics included tumor target engagement and formation of the TIGIT:SEA-TGT:Fc receptor gamma (FcγRIIIa) trimer complexes in the tumor. An increase in the CUI score, representing an increase in biological activity, was observed during dose escalation, with an apparent plateau between the 0.3 and 6.0 mg/kg levels. Based on safety signals at 6 mg/kg and PK variability at lower doses, 1 and 3 mg/kg were of most interest for further evaluation. Both 1 and 3 mg/kg represented biologically active dose levels as they showed PK and PD activity that were within desirable ranges and had similarly high overall CUI scores relative to all doses evaluated. Dose selection for SEA-TGT was based on biological activity as assessed via PK/PD endpoints and integrated into a CUI model. Based on the totality of clinical data and the CUI results from monotherapy dose escalation from SGNTGT-001, the SEA-TGT dose of 1 mg/kg was determined to be the lowest biologically active dose with acceptable safety and tolerability.Citation Format: Gabriela Patilea-Vrana, John Harrold, Joseph A.

	abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the antibody-producing plasma cells (PC). MM is invariably fatal due to frequent disease relapse and/or treatment refractoriness, and therapies that provide deeper and more durable responses are needed. BiTE® (Bispecific T Cell Engager) molecules are immunotherapy agents that redirect a patient’s T cells to lyse tumor cells by simultaneously engaging a tumor associated antigen (TAA) on cancer cells and CD3ε on T cells. Clinical activity has been observed in MM using BiTE® molecules and other T cell engagers that target B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). BCMA is an attractive MM TAA due to its broad prevalence and restricted normal tissue profile, mainly PCs and plasmablasts. However, heterogenous expression in MM cancer cells, potential antigen loss, and the presence of high levels of soluble BCMA in MM patient sera present challenges that may prevent BCMA-only-targeted therapies from achieving their full potential. To address these issues, we generated a BiTE® molecule capable of engaging BCMA and a second MM TAA, CS1 (also known as SLAMF7). This BiTE® molecule also contains an Fc-based domain to provide half-life extension (HLE). Here, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo properties of this BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE® molecule. The BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE® molecule had nanomolar binding affinity for human BCMA, CS1, and CD3ε and the non-human primate (NHP) orthologues. In vitro, we observed picomolar activity against human MM cell lines with a range of BCMA and CS1 expression in a T cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity (TDCC) assay using human T cells or NHP peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE® molecule retained TDCC activity in the presence of soluble BCMA up to 2500 ng/mL as well as against human MM cells engineered to express only BCMA or CS1. In vivo, this BiTE® molecule inhibited tumor growth in a MM xenograft model. We also evaluated the BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE® molecule in NHP over 15 days (IV dosing; intra-animal dose escalation from 60→240 μg/kg or 180→540 μg/kg on days 1 and 8). We observed hallmarks of BiTE® molecule activity in all groups, including transient decreases in circulating lymphocytes and moderate increases in cytokines like MCP-1. We measured the PC-specific transcripts BCMA and J-chain in NHP bone marrow and blood as surrogates for PC levels using ddPCR. These transcripts were reduced in both treatment groups (≥90\%) with the strongest effects occurring in the 180→540 μg/kg group. Lastly, we showed that CS1 is highly and broadly expressed in MM patient samples and is restricted to a few normal hematopoietic cell types including PCs, NK cells, T cells, and some monocytes. These data suggest that the BCMA-CS1 HLE BiTE® molecule has potent in vitro and in vivo activity and may provide therapeutic benefit for MM patients by expanding the population of MM cancer cells that can be eliminated by a BiTE® molecule while overcoming common mechanisms that can impair BCMA-only-targeted MM therapies.Citation Format: Elizabeth T.

	abstract = {Bispecific T-cell engaging therapies harness the immune system to elicit an effective anticancer response. Modulating the immune activation avoiding potential adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a critical aspect to realizing the full potential of this therapy. The use of suitable exogenous intervention strategies to mitigate the CRS risk without compromising the antitumoral capability of bispecific antibody treatment is crucial. To this end, computational approaches can be instrumental to systematically exploring the effects of combining bispecific antibodies with CRS intervention strategies. Here, we employ a logical model to describe the action of bispecific antibodies and the complex interplay of various immune system components and use it to perform simulation experiments to improve the understanding of the factors affecting CRS. We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the comedications that could ameliorate CRS without impairing tumor clearance. Our results agree with publicly available experimental data suggesting anti-TNF and anti-IL6 as possible co-treatments. Furthermore, we suggest anti-IFNγ as a suitable candidate for clinical studies.},

	abstract = {MUC12 is a transmembrane mucin that is highly expressed in \&gt;50\% of primary and metastatic colorectal tumors. MUC12 is also expressed by normal epithelial cells of the colon and small intestine. Although MUC12 localization in normal epithelial cells is restricted to the apical membrane, expression in tumors is depolarized and shows broad membrane localization. The differential localization of MUC12 in tumor cells as compared with normal cells makes it a potential therapeutic target. Here, we evaluated targeting of MUC12 with a BiTE (bispecific T-cell engager) molecule. We generated a panel of proof-of-concept half-life extended (HLE) BiTE molecules that bind MUC12 on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells. We prioritized one molecule based on in vitro activity for further characterization in vivo. In vitro, the MUC12 HLE BiTE molecule mediated T-cell–redirected lysis of MUC12-expressing cells with half-maximal lysis of 4.4 ± 0.9 to 117 ± 78 pmol/L. In an exploratory cynomolgus monkey toxicology study, the MUC12 HLE BiTE molecule administered at 200 μg/kg with a step dose to 1,000 μg/kg was tolerated with minimal clinical observations. However, higher doses were not tolerated, and there was evidence of damage in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting dose levels projected to be required for antitumor activity may be associated with on-target toxicity. Together, these data demonstrate that the apically restricted expression of MUC12 in normal tissues is accessible to BiTE molecule target engagement and highlight the difficult challenge of identifying tumor-selective antigens for solid tumor T-cell engagers.},

	abstract = {Advanced gastric cancer remains a disease of high unmet medical need. In the United States, most patients present with symptomatic, incurable disease and prognosis is poor, with a 5‐year survival rate of less than 10\%. BiTE® (bispecific T cell engager) immune therapy activates a patient's own T cells to kill tumor cells and has the potential to overcome common mechanisms of therapy resistance. We generated fully human, half-life extended (HLE) BiTE® molecules against the tumor antigens MUC17 and CLDN18.2 for the treatment of gastric cancer. The mucin MUC17 is a protein normally found in the mucosal layer of intestinal epithelial cells that is delocalized and expressed in 45\% of gastric tumors. The claudin CLDN18.2 is a protein normally found in the cellular tight junctions of gastric mucosa and intestinal epithelium that is delocalized and expressed in \&gt;60\% of gastric tumors. AMG 199 (MUC17 HLE BiTE®) and AMG 910 (CLDN18.2 HLE BiTE®) show potent cytotoxic activity against gastric cancer cell lines that express MUC17 or CLDN18.2, respectively, in vitro, and promote significant tumor growth inhibition against established gastric tumor xenograft models in vivo. In preclinical non-human primate (NHP) toxicology studies, both molecules show evidence for BiTE® target engagement, including T cell activation and proliferation, but demonstrate different effects on target-expressing tissue. Weekly administration of AMG 199 is well tolerated in NHP with minimal findings in MUC17-expressing normal tissues. In contrast, treatment with AMG 910 led to direct cell killing of CLDN18.2-expressing gastric mucosal cells in NHP, a finding which was fully reversible once treatment was stopped. AMG 199 and AMG 910 may offer the potential to improve outcomes in advanced gastric patients worldwide.Citation Format: Julie M.

In mice and monkeys, these molecules reduce body weight (BW) and improve many metabolic parameters. BW loss is greater with GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 than with GIPR-Ab or a control antibody conjugate, suggesting synergistic effects. GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 also reduces the respiratory exchange ratio in DIO mice. Simultaneous receptor binding and rapid receptor internalization by GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 amplify endosomal cAMP production in recombinant cells expressing both receptors.

title = {{Interspecies Scaling of Receptor-Mediated Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Type I Interferons}},
abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an integrated mechanism-based modeling approach for the interspecies scaling of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of type I interferons (IFNs) that exhibit target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD). METHODS: PK and PD profiles of human IFN-beta1a, IFN-beta1b, and IFN-alpha2a in humans, monkeys, rats, and mice from nine studies were extracted from the literature by digitization. Concentration-time profiles from different species were fitted simultaneously using various allometric relationships to scale model-specific parameters. RESULTS: PK/PD profiles of IFN-beta1a in humans and monkeys were successfully characterized by utilizing the same rate constant parameters and scaling the volume of the central compartment to body weight using an allometric exponent of 1. Concentration and effect profiles of other IFNs were also well described by changing only the affinity of the drug to its receptor. PK profiles in rodents were simulated using an allometric exponent of -0.25 for the first-order elimination rate constant, and no receptor-binding was included given the lack of cross-reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated TMDD PK/PD model was successfully combined with classic allometric scaling techniques and showed good predictive performance. Several parameters obtained from one IFN can be effectively shared to predict the kinetic behavior of other IFN subtypes.},

title = {Differential pharmacodynamic effects of paclitaxel formulations in an intracranial rat brain tumor model},
abstract = {Nano- and micro-particulate carriers can exert beneficial impact upon the pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents. To investigate the relationships between carrier and antitumor pharmacodynamics, paclitaxel incorporated in liposomes (L-pac) was compared to the clinical standard formulated in Cremophor-EL/ethanol (Cre-pac) in a rat model of advanced primary brain cancer. Three maximum-tolerated-dose regimens given by iv administration were investigated: 50 mg/kg on day 8 (d8) after implantation of 9L gliosarcoma tumors; 40 mg/kg on d8 and d15; 20 mg/kg on d8, d11 and d15. Body weight change and neutropenia were assessed as pharmacodynamic markers of toxicity. The pharmacodynamic markers of antitumor efficacy were increase in lifespan (ILS) and tumor volume progression, measured non-invasively by magnetic resonance imaging. At equivalent doses, neutropenia was similar for both formulations, but weight loss was more severe for Cre-pac. No regimen of Cre-pac extended survival, whereas L-pac at 40 mg/kg x2 doses was well-tolerated and mediated 26%ILS (p<0.0002) compared to controls. L-pac at a lower cumulative dose (20 mg/kg x3) was even more effective (40%ILS; p<0.0001). In striking contrast, the identical regimen of Cre-pac was lethal. Development of a novel semi-mechanistic pharmacodynamic model permitted quantitative hypothesis testing with the tumor volume progression data, and suggested the existence of a transient treatment effect that was consistent with sensitization or 'priming' of tumors by more frequent L-pac dosing schedules. Therefore, improved antitumor responses of carrier-based paclitaxel formulations can arise both from dose escalation, owing to reduced toxicity, and from novel carrier-mediated alterations of antitumor pharmacodynamic effects.},
